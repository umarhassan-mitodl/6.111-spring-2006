description: Laboratory assignment to implement a traffic light controller that operates
  main street, side street and walk lamps. You will be using a finite state machine
  to implement this controller. This lab provides a design methodology that will be
  useful in future labs and final projects. This involves planning your design, coding,
  wiring, and debugging your design.
