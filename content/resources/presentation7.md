description: 'Example of student work: final project presentation by Masood Qazi and
  Zhongying Zhou. A Karaoke machine will be implemented for the purpose of vocal training.
  It will have as its two primary inputs the user''s singing and the notes from the
  sheet music of the vocals for a selected song. The user''s voice will be recorded
  through a microphone interfaced to an analog to digital converter. The user''s song
  will be analyzed with digital filters to determine the local spectral content. The
  system will then compare the user''s singing, by pitch and rhythm, with what is
  described in the sheet music. This comparative analysis will be presented in a meaningful
  way to the user through a VGA display. Finally, the user will also have access to
  audio outputs such as the sequence of correct tones and the user''s recorded voice
  through headphones.'
