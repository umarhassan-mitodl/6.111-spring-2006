description: 'Example of student work: project code for a final project by Masood
  Qazi and Zhongying Zhou. A Karaoke machine will be implemented for the purpose of
  vocal training. It will have as its two primary inputs the user''s singing and the
  notes from the sheet music of the vocals for a selected song. The user''s voice
  will be recorded through a microphone interfaced to an analog to digital converter.
  The user''s song will be analyzed with digital filters to determine the local spectral
  content. The system will then compare the user''s singing, by pitch and rhythm,
  with what is described in the sheet music. This comparative analysis will be presented
  in a meaningful way to the user through a VGA display. Finally, the user will also
  have access to audio outputs such as the sequence of correct tones and the user''s
  recorded voice through headphones.'
