description: 'Example of student work: final project report by Igor Ginsburg. 3D Pong
  takes MIT Pong to the next level with a 3D interface. At the heart of the project
  there is a hardware based 3D renderer. The renderer takes in a 3D model, specifically
  a sequence of colored triangles in a 3D space, and produces a 2D SVGA image. The
  view is controlled through a trackball mouse, which specifies rotations, translations
  and zoom. While the renderer can take in pre-built models stored in on-chip ROM,
  during gameplay a model of the current board is generated dynamically.'
