description: 'Example of student work: final project report by Noel Campbell, Vivek
  Shah, and Raymond Tong. This project implements a networked video surveillance system
  in digital logic. It allows a user to view video input from a remote camera on a
  VGA monitor by capturing camera data, encoding it, transmitting it wirelessly, and
  subsequently receiving, decoding, and re-displaying the data. To test the system,
  the project is divided into three main components: video capture/display, data encoding/decoding,
  and wireless transmission/reception. Each part is put through a comprehensive series
  of tests using ModelSim and simulated data. Once each component passes design and
  functional tests, all three components are then connected to transmit video data
  wirelessly.'
