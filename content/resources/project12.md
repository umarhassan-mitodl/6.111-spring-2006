description: 'Example of student work: final project report by Helen Liang, Wendi
  Li, David Meyer, Lucia Tian. Inspired by the FAO Schwartz piano, Piano Dance Revolution
  consists of a large piano keyboard projected onto the floor. The user interacts
  with the piano by stepping on the keys. At every step, the activated keys will light
  up and the corresponding note will play from the speakers. This is accomplished
  through three major components: the projectors, which project the image of the piano
  onto the ground and changes the color of the keys upon activation; the motion detection
  system, which detects the location of the player''s feet and determines the key
  stepped on; and audio output, which plays the activated note.'
