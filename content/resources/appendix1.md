description: 'Example of student work: project code for a final project by David Blau,
  Uzoma Orji, and Reesa Phillips. "Let''s Take This Outside" Boxing is a one player
  or two player game in which fighter box to the death. The user interface is comprised
  of a camera and gloves equipped with accelerometers. The camera detects the position
  of the gloves and the accelerometers measure the force of a punch. The position
  of the boxer is inferred from the on-screen coordinates of the gloves. When a punch
  is detected, the control unit determines whether the punch hit the opponent and
  how forceful it was. The more forceful the punch, the more damage is done. The game
  continues until one player loses all her life. The output displays an image of the
  gloves and the opponent and health meter. The fighters, their health meters, and
  the boxing ring are drawn using sprites read from ROM.'
