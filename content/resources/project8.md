description: 'Example of student work: final project report by Mariela Buchin, WonRon
  Cho, and Scott Fisher. This project involves the creation of a "smart flight vest"
  that detects movements from a human body and translates them into parameters that
  determine the pitch and roll of an airplane in flight. The throttle of the plane
  is determined by a pressure sensor located under the pilot''s foot. The pilot flying
  the plane stands in front of a monitor that displays the main features of an airplane
  console, including an attitude indicator, a compass, and an altitude and vertical
  velocity display.'
