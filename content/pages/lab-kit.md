The new 6.111 FPGA lab kit is a state-of-the-art platform for prototyping digital designs. Based on a 6-million gate platform-scale FPGA, the lab kit is designed to facilitate complex and high-performance projects. The lab kit is based on a Virtex II FPGA from [Xilinx, Inc](http://www.xilinx.com/). For more details, please refer to the [lab kit documentation](http://www-mtl.mit.edu/Courses/6.111/labkit/).
